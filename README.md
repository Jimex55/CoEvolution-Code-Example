# CoEvolution-Code-Example
Some portions of code from my coevolution simulation within Unity 

Reproduction mechanic is how the agents reproduce and pass on their genetics

Idle State is how an agent idly acts

State hold functions but is inherited by all states

State Manager checks what state the agent should be in and activates that state.
